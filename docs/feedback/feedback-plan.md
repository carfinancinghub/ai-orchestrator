üèõÔ∏è CFH Post-Launch User Feedback Collection Plan
Version: 1.0.0
Date: August 14, 2025

This document outlines the multi-channel strategy for collecting, analyzing, and prioritizing user feedback to drive continuous improvement of the Car Financing Hub (CFH) platform.

1. Feedback Collection Methods
In-App Surveys & Forms:

Strategy: Place non-intrusive feedback widgets at the end of key user flows (e.g., after a listing is created, after an auction is finalized in AuctionDetailPage.tsx).

Implementation: A simple "How was your experience?" form with a 1-5 star rating and an optional comment field.

Logging: All submissions will trigger a HistoryService.logAction event with actionType: 'SUBMIT_IN_APP_FEEDBACK'.

Email Campaigns:

Schedule: Monthly

Strategy: Send targeted email surveys to different user segments (e.g., new sellers, high-volume lenders) asking for specific feedback on the features they use most.

Logging: Feedback received via email will be manually logged by the community team using an internal admin tool, triggering a HistoryService.logAction event with actionType: 'SUBMIT_EMAIL_FEEDBACK'.

Social Media Monitoring:

Schedule: Continuous

Tools: Brand monitoring tools (e.g., Brand24, Mention).

Strategy: Actively monitor platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit for mentions of "Car Financing Hub" or "CFH". Track sentiment and identify common feature requests or pain points.

Logging: Significant findings will be logged by the community team with actionType: 'LOG_SOCIAL_MEDIA_FEEDBACK'.

Support Ticket Analysis:

Schedule: Weekly

Strategy: The support team will tag all incoming tickets with relevant feature areas (e.g., "bidding," "payouts," "UI"). A weekly report will be generated to identify the most frequent points of friction for users.

Logging: The weekly summary report will be logged with actionType: 'LOG_SUPPORT_TICKET_TRENDS'.

2. Feedback Prioritization & Action Plan
Centralization: All feedback, regardless of source, will be aggregated into a central database (e.g., a Jira project or a dedicated feedback collection tool).

Analysis: The product team will conduct a weekly review of all new feedback, tagging and categorizing it based on user role, feature area, and potential impact.

Prioritization: Feedback will be prioritized based on a matrix of Frequency (how many users are asking for it) and Impact (how much it aligns with our business goals, such as driving premium upgrades).

Development Cycle: The highest-priority feedback will be converted into user stories and added to the development backlog for upcoming sprints. This may involve creating new API endpoints (e.g., in auctionController.ts) or enhancing existing UI components.
