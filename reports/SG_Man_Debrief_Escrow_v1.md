# SG Man Debrief â€” Cod1 [Orchestrator Escrow v1]
_report to: SG Man â€¢ generated: 

## 1) High-Level Objective
Deliver **Escrow Phase 1** scaffolding + artifacts, stable deps, and a clean PR/tag so Phase 3 (Redis queue) can begin with confidence.

## 2) What Landed in Phase 1
- **Plans**: 27 MD specs under eports/reviews/Escrow/
- **Stubs**: 125 TSX under src/_ai_out/**
- **Deps**: eports/deps/resolved_deps.json (stable)
- **README**: eports/README_escrow_v1.md
- **Wave scripts/metrics**: scripts/run_full_wave.ps1, eports/wave_metrics_*.csv
- **Redis Phase 3 bootstrap**:
  - Plan: eports/redis_escrow_plan.md
  - Stub: src/_ai_out/redis_stubs/EscrowQueueService.tsx
  - TSC log: eports/logs/redis_tsc.txt
  - Canonical ZIP: eports/redis_escrow_v1.zip

## 3) Git / CI Status
- PR **#26** merged into main (squash).
- Tag moved to **\1.0-escrow\** on merged main.
- Secret hooks verified; leaked helper removed; .gitignore hardened (	ools/cod1/*.txt).

## 4) Operational Health
- API on **8121** healthy (/readyz OK).
- Providers enabled: OpenAI, Gemini, Grok (Anthropic intentionally off).
- Reports dir writable; CFH roots present.

## 5) Wave Metrics (latest tails)
- **Auctions**: (see eports/wave_metrics_auctions.csv, last line)
- **Escrow**:   (see eports/wave_metrics_escrow.csv, last line)

> Example (at time of merge):
> - auctions: ""2025-10-16T00:13:39Z","dry-run","premium","auctions","0","0","0.86","2""
> - escrow:   ""2025-10-16T00:13:39Z","dry-run","premium","escrow","0","1","0.86","2""

## 6) Phase 3 (Redis) â€” Next Minimal Steps
1. Implement EscrowQueueService no-op â†’ Redis-backed methods:
   - nqueueEscrowJob(payload), dequeue(), ck(id), ail(id, reason).
2. Config flags (no secrets in repo):
   - .env.local (dev machine only): REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
   - Feature gate: CFH_REDIS_ESCROW=1
3. Health and observability:
   - Add /redis/health + log counters to wave metrics.
4. Thin tests (no external Redis required):
   - Use in-memory adapter by default; Redis adapter behind flag.
5. Wire one happy-path call from an Escrow stub to the queue service (feature-flagged).

## 7) Risks & Mitigations
- **Secrets**: Hooks are active; .gitignore updated. Mitigation: keep helpers out of repo; rotate keys if ever committed upstream.
- **Flaky local env**: Keep Anthropic off; fail closed if missing keys.
- **Noise in reports/**: Artifacts are under ignored paths; only curated MD/JSON kept in Git.

## 8) Ready for Review
- Everything required for Escrow v1 is landed and tagged.
- Phase 3 can begin immediately with the above thin-slice plan.
