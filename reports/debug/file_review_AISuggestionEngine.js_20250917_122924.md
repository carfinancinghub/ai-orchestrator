## Summary
- Path: C:\c\ai-orchestrator\artifacts\zip_stage\batch_1\batch_1\AISuggestionEngine.js
- Size: 1967 bytes
- Needs type work: yes

## Notable Elements
- Hooks used: `useState`, `useEffect` if present
- Routing/lazy: check `React.lazy`/`Suspense`
- Props flow: identify prop drilling vs context

## Conversion Needs
- Add typed state/effect dependencies; prefer explicit types when crossing module boundaries
- Type network responses; define DTOs and narrow to view models

## Remote Check
- Remote not fetched or no local content

## Next Steps
1) Suggest features (perform worth scoring)
2) Generate spec MD
3) Generate TS/TSX
4) Re-review vs spec & suggestions
