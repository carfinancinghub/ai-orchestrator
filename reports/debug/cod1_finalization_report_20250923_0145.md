- **Key Logs**: reports\health_*.json
- **Outputs**: PR #17 merged
- **Notes**: \gh pr view 17\ showed { draft: false, mergeable: MERGEABLE, state: CLEAN } prior to merge.

### [Task 3] Tune CFH Lint Gate
- **Status**: ✅ Partial (soft mode)
- **Description**: CFH lint gate runs locally and in CI; currently **soft** via \CFH_LINT_SOFT=1\ to avoid blocking while allow-list is tuned.
