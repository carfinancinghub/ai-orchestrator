Inputs: `reports/ai_review_20250923_084351.md` (7 fences with `path=@…`).
Batch: ≤25 files → `ts-migration/generated/20250923_2212/` (in CFH repo).

**Sample compliance**  
- `LoanTerms` interface present at `@types/finance/LoanTerms.ts`  
- `monthlyPayment()` amortization uses r = APR/12; zero-rate branch returns P/n; result fixed to 2 decimals  
- All imports use “@” aliases (no relative `../`).
