# 1) What we changed (since last SG Man touchpoint)

- **Sanitize working tree**
  - Added strong ignores for deps/venvs and inventory CSV.
  - Ignored orchestrator artifacts and snapshot workspaces.
- **Line endings & linguist**
  - Added `.gitattributes` to normalize LF and mark vendored outputs.
- **Pre-commit gate hardening**
  - `scripts/check-no-js.ps1`: scans **staged** files only; excludes `artifacts/` and `reports/*_workspace_collect/`; YAML parse stays.
- **History rewrite (git_filter_repo)**
  - Removed from **all history**:
    - `**/node_modules/**`, `**/.venv/**`, `**/venv/**`, `**/__pycache__/**`
    - `**/dist/**`, `**/build/**`, `**/out/**`, `**/.next/**`, `**/coverage/**`
    - `reports/inv_orchestrator_files.csv`
    - `artifacts/*`, `reports/*_workspace_collect/*`
  - Cleaned the one lingering `connectionString` hit (`node_modules/expect-type/README.md`).
- **Merge + Visibility**
  - PR **#7** merged: “Sanitize public surface (phase 1)”.
  - Repo visibility: **public**.
  - Enabled **secret push protection** (secret scanning not available on plan).

# 2) Evidence / Commands executed

- Branch & PR:
  - `fix/public-sanitize-1` → merged into `main` (PR #7).
- History rewrite:
  - `py -m git_filter_repo --force --invert-paths ...`
  - Re-add `origin` and `git push -f origin main` (and PR branch).
- Security toggles:
  - `gh repo edit ... --visibility public --accept-visibility-change-consequences`
  - `gh repo edit ... --enable-secret-scanning-push-protection`

# 3) Current state vs goals

| Goal                                             | Status  | Notes |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------|------|
| Remove vendor/venv/build artifacts from history  | ✅ Done | Verified by history scans (no hits) |
| Harden pre-commit to ignore artifacts noise      | ✅ Done | Scans staged JS/JSX, preserves YAML check |
| Publish AI review doc                            | ✅ Done | `reports/ai_review_20250923_084351.md` |
| Public visibility & basic protections            | ✅ Done | Push-protection on; secret scanning not in plan |

# 4) Risks / Watch-outs

- **Scanners not installed (optional hardening):** `ripgrep`, `detect-secrets`, `trufflehog` not yet added to CI; local use recommended.
- **Branch protections (suggested):** ensure `main` has required status checks and linear history if desired.
- **Actions logs:** confirm no secrets echo in workflow output.

# 5) Next actions (ordered)

1. **Enable branch protection on `main`**
   - Required status checks: lint gates & CI.
2. **Add lightweight secret scan to CI (optional)**
   - Run `detect-secrets scan` and `trufflehog filesystem` in a harmless mode; fail only on high-confidence hits.
3. **(Optional) Public mirror**
   - If you want a minimal public surface, mirror only `reports/` + workflows to `carfinancinghub/ai-orchestrator-public`.
